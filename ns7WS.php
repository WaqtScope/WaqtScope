        WaqtScope is a nice standalone webpage, that can work also offline, which calculates Muslim Prayer times 
        (five waqts: Fajr, Dhuhr, Asr, Maghrib, Isha) and other relevant times.
        Fajr time starts with dawn and ends just before sunrise; Dhuhr is to be performed in the noon and Asr is the prayer of afternoon; 
        as sunsets waqt of Ars ends and afterwards in evening Maghrib starts; Maghrib time remains while there is a twilight visible in 
        the sky; after twilight diminishes and night falls dark, Isha waqt commences.
        <br/>
        For sawm, sahri shall be taken before Subhe-sadik (start of dawn). Time to finish Sahri is marked as Imsak. Iftar time is the same
        as that of Maghrib. 
        <br />
        Several methods are followed around the world to determine time. You may need to select one from the menu available on the left.
        <br />
        Salat times differ for locations. You can set your location (or nearest location) and timezone from the settings on the right. 
        Current version do not provide option to set geographic coordinates (longd, latid, altid) manually - later release plans to provide so. 
        DST of timezones will be available in later versions as well.
        <br />
        
        version: 1.0.0; released: 1<sup>st</sup>Ramadan (2 Aug), 2011.
